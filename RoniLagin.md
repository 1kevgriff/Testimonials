Kevin Griffin, of Griffin Consulting, is as professional as they come. His attention to detail and knowledge of current technologies always gave me peace of mind when he is involved with any project. He was also able to work some magic on some old systems and software that needed updating, when many others said it couldn't be done or couldn't even problem solve. Kevin is very reasonable when it comes to estimating the time needed to finished projects and always delivers on deadline and often even before it's due. I look forward to every project where Kevin is at the helm.
